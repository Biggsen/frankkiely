29th June – 10th July 2016

The Bankside Gallery in collaboration with the Globe Theatre are staging an exhibition by members of the Royal Watercolour Society and Royal Society of Painter-Printmakers in celebration of Shakespeare’s 400th anniversary.  There is a wonderful array of pictures on show that are inspired by different aspects of Shakespeare’s work.

I have responded to three of Shakespeare’s plays: Hamlet, A Midsummers Night’s Dream and Richard III. In each of my pictures I have acted out a character from these plays.

Shakespeare: A Celebration was filmed by Right Angle during the hang and private view.  It’s a great video, so if you’d like to watch it just follow this <a href="http://bit.ly/29GSCr6)" target="_blank">link</a>.

## Artist Talk at Barr Gazetas Ltd, London

**January 2016**

It's been well known to me that Architects are my biggest fans, we have many of the same loves and utilise many of the same tools. So perhaps it should not seem surprising to me that I keep on being asked to talk about my practice at Architectural firms.

This month Barr Gazetas in central London invited me in to speak to them about how I make my pictures.

I designed this talk on the making of my pictures low tech verses high tech. I shared sketches of pictures I am currently working up into prints to demonstrate how I work with pencil and paper first to break down my images before I remake them as screenprints. I also brought in a selection of finished prints and some of my sketch books. There were many an insightful question and one person even picked up on my poetry efforts inside a sketchbook (Please find the poem below).
